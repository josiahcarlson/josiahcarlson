    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>I've been meaning to move a blog or something over here, but I've been busy with many other things.</p>
    <p><b>Blog:</b> for now, my blog lives at <a href="https://www.dr-josiah.com/">dr-josiah.com</a>, you may have issues with
      script blockers / other stuff if you're not in Chrome. Thank you for your patience; it is part of why
      I'm moving here at some point.</p>
    <p><b>Documentation:</b>if you're looking for the documentation on <a href="/rom/">rom</a> (my Python/Redis object mapper) or one of my
      <a href="https://github.com/josiahcarlson/">other projects</a>, click through.</p>
    <p><b>Donate:</b> and lastly, if you think that I've helped you, and you want to toss a bit of coin my way, you can
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KCLAA975QS384&source=url">Donate via PayPal</a>
      or Bitcoin: <tt>bitcoin:19ZqAMkXzimsJD8QRBsHTPP7Wkeg6WtUf4</tt></p>
